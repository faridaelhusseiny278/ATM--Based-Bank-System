# ATM-Based-Bank-System

This project implements ASIC design and verification on ATM-based bank system


The project assumes that all auxiliary devices, such as card handling, money counting, and timers, already exist. In addition, 
it assumes that account information, such as passwords, account numbers, and balances, exist locally with no need for a database connection.

The ATM system contains several auxiliaries, including card handling, language used, card password, and operations such as deposit, 
withdrawal, and balance service. It also includes the ability to check balances, deposit and withdraw money, and request other services.

Each group will be divided into a "Design Team" and a "Verification Team". The Design Team will be responsible for system architecture, 
high-level modeling, creating a reference model, and writing the Verilog code. The Verification Team will create a testbench that covers test stimulus using 
variations of directed and constraint random testing, self-checking TB using reference models, define design properties or assertions using PSL, enable 
code coverage, and create coverage reports for statement, branch, and FSM coverage
